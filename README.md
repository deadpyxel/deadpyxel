# Robson Cruz (deadpyxel)

### I am a SRE that likes to solve developer problems and automate quality processes.

‚§∑ I am curious and like to poke things to see how they work. If you like Open Source, Linux, Cybersecurity and solving engineering problems and puzzles, let's talk!

‚§∑ I love to create developer tools to make our work easier.
