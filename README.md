# Robson Cruz (deadpyxel)
### I am a DevOps Developer that like to solve developer problems and automate quality processes.

⤷ I like to break things down so I can understand them and build something better. My core principle is that continuous improvement is a must. If you like Open Source, Linux, Cybersecurity and solving engineering problems let's talk!
