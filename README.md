# Robson Cruz (deadpyxel)

### I am a SRE that likes to solve developer problems and automate quality processes.

‚§∑ I like to break things down so I can understand them and build something better. My core principle is that continuous improvement is a must. If you like Open Source, Linux, Cybersecurity and solving engineering problems let's talk!

‚§∑ I love to create developer tools to make our work easier.
